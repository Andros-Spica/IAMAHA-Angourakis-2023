**_Abstract_**

Simulation and machine learning are two powerful approaches to understanding complex phenomena. Simulation modelling, including but not only system dynamics and agent-based modelling, is to design models to reproduce patterns and trends in empirical data as outcomes of postulated mechanisms under controlled conditions. Machine learning is a family of data-based or descriptive approaches that involve the creation of models able to recognize patterns and make predictions based on large datasets. Despite their shared background and fundamental relationship to AI, they differ in several aspects, among which the most essential is how causality is considered. More recently, both epistemological and pragmatical differences between these approaches have contributed to the unfortunate distancing between communities of practice, particularly accentuated in the study of past complex systems.

However, acknowledging these differences also reveals an opportunity to combine them and bring a more powerful paradigm to light [1]. Simulation can be used for machine learning (generating training datasets and hypotheses sets, serving as learning algorithms, validating final hypotheses) and, conversely, machine learning can be used for simulation (model generation, selecting and processing input data, detecting patterns in simulation output, calibrating parameters, serving as a simulation model component). Deep learning, and particularly the latest generations of large language models, brings the potential of mixed workflows to a new, unforeseen level.
This lecture will present an epistemological outline of simulation and machine learning and emphasize the potential of hybrid methodologies to address complex socio-environmental systems. Although there are still a few examples of deliberate applications, I will overview a selection of explored and unexplored use cases, including insights from previous and current work modelling ancient agriculture and foodways [3,4,5].
